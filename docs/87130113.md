# Helpcenter : How Do I create a Report in DataLion? \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 23, 2024

**What is a report in DataLion?**

A report is assigned to a specific project and contains one or more dashboards (pages), which in turn contain several charts/diagrams.

The report can contain other elements besides charts, e.g. images or text fields.

Examples:

1.  **Create a report**

You can also copy or delete here an existing report.

2.  **Name report**
    

In the next step, this window opens, and you choose a title for your report. For a better overview, we recommend a thematic reference of the title to the content, but you can of course also simply number your reports consecutively.

4.  **Create charts**
    

Select the questions relevant to you in the navigation on the left and drag them to the right ("Drag&Drop") or click on the respective variable/term(s). The chart will then be created automatically.

**Important:** Before a report can be released to different users, the user must be released for the project in a user role in the backend.
