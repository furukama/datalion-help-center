# Helpcenter : Generate automatic codebook - part 2 \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 24, 2024

When you import data, you can have a codebook created. Therefore, select "**Create codebook after import**" in the data import menu. The codebook is available in the system. You are ready to start. Advantage: You do not have to do changes in the codebook and reupload it. But you can do so by exporting, editing, and importing it again in the Backend under "Codebook".

Please note: If DataLion creates a codebook based on the csv dataset, the codebook entry for each variable/column is created depending on the column’s content. Either a codebook entry for numeric values (numeric variable) or a codebook entry for variables with labels (character variable) is created.

**Character variable**: Each distinct value of the variable is listed in the codebook.

Numeric variable: Only one row is created for that variable in the codebook, containing the `<num>` command. The `<num>` command calls the individual numbers from the datatable.

It can happen that DataLion does not interpret the variable type as desired. For example, a column containing years (2018, 2919, 2020...) is interpreted as a numeric variable because it contains only numbers. However, you would probably not want to output a numeric value for this variable, but rather map each individual year as an individual expression. In this case, you can export the codebook, make the desired adjustments, and import the codebook again.

Codebook variable with `<num>` command:

Output in the DataLion frontend:

Codebook variable with labels:
