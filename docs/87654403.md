## Define metrics via codebook 

Find out [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/4958821724818-Define-metric-per-chart-via-codebook) how to use the codebook to predefine the metric in which the chart should be output for each codebook question. This feature is particularly useful when you have a large number of questions in a chart that you do not want to be reported in the project's [standard metric](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/4417739351826-Settings-for-displaying-values-Value-display).

## Define basis via the codebook 

Learn [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/4418323919762-Codebook-Different-bases-calculate-the-base-of-a-question-yourself) how to set the basis of a chart using the codebook. This feature is useful when you want calculations such as percentages to be based on values other than the actual number of cases.

## Weight via the drop down menu

Find out [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/4418412320402-Weight-via-the-dropdown-menu) what is entered into the codebook to weight in the dashboards via the drop-down menu. This feature helps you if the values on the dashboard are to be weighted differently depending on the filter selection in the drop-down menu.
