# Use multiple data sources in a project [Article under maintenance]

DataLion offers the possibility to use several data sources in one project - and to link them to each other if necessary (join).

1.  import your main table in the **Project Backend `>` Data**.

2.  Import your second table in the Project Backend `>` **Data Sources** by clicking on **New**. Important: Enter any suffix for this table. This allows you to access the table later, e.g. via the codebook.

3.  Optional: If you want to link the data tables with each other, select the key variable from the data table to be linked and the current data table in the **Joins** area of the data source (see image below). Save it. The rows of the two data tables are assigned to each other via the key and the data records are thus linked to one another.
    

If you want to view the data from both data tables independently of each other, no join is necessary. There is also the option of not linking tables and still using variables that appear in both data tables as a filter across both data tables. You can find out how to do so [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/4418325064466-A-filter-variable-from-different-data-sources).

4.  **Codebook**. In the codebook, add a column called S**uffix**. For codebook entries that do not refer to variables in the main table, add the suffix of the relevant table to this column.

Import the codebook. Now you can visualize data from both data tables in your project.
