# How do I create an XY bubble chart? [Article uner maintenance]

In DataLion, there is the chart type "XY bubble chart" that can display data very clearly in three dimensions.

![mceclip0.png](/img/88178693.png)

An example from support: The x and y axes show two values, for example importance and rating of different brand attributes. The size of the bubbles can then also represent a third dimension, for example the number of customer support requests on this topic.

This diagram can be built as follows:

1.  A question in the code book defines the three values in its three forms, i.e. here: score, relevance and number of queries (for the size of the bubbles)
    
2.  Another question defines the different bubbles that are then used for aggregation. These can be product dimensions, as in the example, but also brands or countries.
    
3.  The chart is then created in such a way that the question with the three characteristics is visualized as an XY bubble diagram and the dimensions (= bubbles) are then dragged onto the question as a filter.
    

The data structure then looks like this:

``
id;product dimension;score;relevance
1;1;2;3
1;2;2;2
1;3;2;3
2;4;5;3
3;2;1;2
4;2;1;2
5;3;1;3
5;4;5;3
...
``
And the code book:

``
row_id;question_id;variable;value;description;short_description;type;chart_type
1;1;product dimension;;product dimensions;product dimensions;question;b-bar
2;1;product dimension;1;quality;product dimensions;value;b-bar
3;1;product dimension;2;price;product dimensions;value;b-bar
4;1;product dimension;3;usability;product dimensions;value;b-bar
5;1;product dimension;4;delivery speed;product dimensions;value;b-bar
6;2;;;XY Bubble Chart;XY Bubble Chart;Question;b-bar
7;2;score;{{= AVG(score) }};Score;XY Bubble Chart;value;b-bar
8;2;relevance;{{= AVG(relevance) }};relevance;XY Bubble Chart;value;b-bar
9;2;id;{{= COUNT(DISTINCT id) }};Count;XY Bubble Chart;value;b-bar
``
