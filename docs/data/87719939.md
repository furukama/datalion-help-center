# A filter variable from different data sources [Article under maintenance]

If you use several data sources in a project - regardless of whether they are connected to one another via a key variable or not - some variables may appear in all data sources. For you not to have to create the variables multiple times in the codebook and use the same (drop-down) filters across the different data sources you can work with an "auxiliary suffix". The \* in the _table\_suffix_ column in the codebook tells DataLion that the variable occurs in all data sets.

**Important:** Variable names and values in the different data sources must be identical.
