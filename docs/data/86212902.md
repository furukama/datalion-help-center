# How can I change and customize fonts in DataLion? [Article under maintenance]

You can change fonts for various elements in the project settings in the "Content" tab in the "Custom CSS Styles" section. For this you have to insert a CSS code at this point. You can find out how to use CSS [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/360021463799-What-is-CSS-).

The code structures for changing the font can be found [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/4426668104978-Specific-HTML-CSS-elements-in-DataLion).
