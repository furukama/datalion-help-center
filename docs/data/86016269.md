# What is CSS? [Article under maintenance]

CSS is a language that defines and controls the appearance of HTML elements. In DataLion, you can use CSS to change the layout of texts, charts, headings, and buttons.

**The CSS syntax**

A CSS ruleset consists of a selector and an explanation block. The selector tells the software which object the styles refer to and the explanation blocks define the style.

``
selector {explanation block;explanation block}
``
An explanation block consists of a property and a value. The properties point to the type of change and the value then sets the color, for example.

``
selector `{property:value; property:value;}
``
``
Example: p { color: #efefef; text-align:center;}
``
``
Translated: textblock
``
In this example, the color is set to a specific hex (alternatively, an RGB value can be used) and the text is centered. Here, the selector points to the HTML element <p>, which stands for a normal text paragraph.
