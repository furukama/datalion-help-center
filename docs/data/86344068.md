# What is HTML? [Article under maintenance]

HTML is a standardized structuring language for websites. At DataLion you can use HTML to adapt the start pages of your projects to your corporate identity. You can implement this under the project settings under content or in the report settings:

**The HTML syntax**

HTML has its own syntax. This consists of tags, which are marked by `<`>. With these, you can tell the website which block or element you are currently navigating to. A block is opened with `<`> and must be closed again at the end with `</>`. The tags are predefined by HTML and cannot be freely selected.
