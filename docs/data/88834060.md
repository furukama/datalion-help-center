# How do I create a time series chart? [Article under maintenance]

In the backend, you have to specify which variable contains the timestamp. The corresponding field can be found under Projects → Data:

If you do not have a timestamp but a **non-timestamp variable** (e.g., "Wave 1", "Wave 2"), you can either enter the codebook's Row\_ID of the variable you'd like to use for the time series scale or you can enter the variable name from the data set. If you use the variable name, the values used for the scale of the time series are taken directly from the data set. If you use the Row\_ID, on the other hand, the predefined values from the codebook are used for the scale of the time series, i.e. possibly also values that do not occur in the data set or even fewer values than actually occur in the data set.

If you have a **timestamp variable** in your data file (e.g., "2019-12-08"), you can select the column under "Timestamp column". Moreover, if you have a timestamp variable. you can select the default time interval and the format of the quarter.

Afterward, any questions can be displayed as time series by selecting "Timeline (new)" as the chart type. The result is a time series chart

**Time intervals**

For timestamp variables, the displayed time interval can then be customized in the **chart menu>Time interval**:

**Layout**

Also, the **Layout** can be set in the chart menu: Lines, bars or stacked bars. If you use several variables in the time series chart (merged), you can define the layout per variable.

**Axis**

In the chart menu, the **Axis** button can be used to define which variable is to be displayed on which axis. Click on the label of the variable via the Axis button to change the axis from Left to Right and vice versa.

**Cumulation**

By clicking the **Cumulated** button in the chart menu you can output your data cumulatively.

**Smoothing**

The **SMA** (simple moving average) can be output in time series charts via the chart settings menu. In the field **Window**, it can be set over how many data points the SMA is to be calculated. The settings can be made in the **Chart Settings Menu>Timeline Settings**.
