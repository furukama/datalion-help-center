To apply chart settings to other charts, enter a name for the setting in the "Settings name" field of the chart menu (bottom left). The setting can then be selected and used in any other chart via the **Load Chart settings** button in the gear menu. Please note that if the setting is changed in a chart, this change affects all charts that have this chart setting stored.
