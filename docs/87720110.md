# Helpcenter : How do I create raw data charts? \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher, last modified on Sept. 24, 2024

Raw data charts pull a variable's labels directly from the data set rather than from the codebook.

A possible application is e.g. the display of free entries in table form.

The variable for a raw data query from the data set must be created in the code book as follows:

I.e. the codebook question has only one form. For this, the raw text from the data record column is queried in the "Value" codebook column using an SQL formula `{{=variable_name}}`.

With this codebook question, a chart is then created in the frontend, for example a table.

In the chart **Settings > Advanced** settings of this chart, select the **Query type** "Labels from raw data".

Chart settings menu:

The table now shows all unique labels from the dataset column used and the number of mentions.
