# Reports overview [Article under maintenance]

In the project backend, you can see an overview of all **reports** of a project in the Reports tab. The ReportID, the report name, the number of tabs, the number of editors and viewers and the report owner are displayed.

A report is archived by clicking on **Archive**. It then no longer appears in the overview of active reports and is also no longer displayed in the frontend in the report dropdown (folder symbol in the horizontal top bar in the frontend).

Clicking on **Edit** takes you to the report settings.

In the drop-down menu at the top left, you can select whether active or also inactive reports should be displayed in the list.

If you display all reports, you can reactivate reports by clicking on **Unarchive**.
