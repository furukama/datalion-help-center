# Helpcenter : The Codebook Generator \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 24, 2024

A code book can be automatically generated in DataLion with an SPSS data set.

To do this, you have to log into DataLion and be on the project level - which project is not decisive. The generator can then be found in the right navigation bar:

A dialog opens to upload the SPSS data:

Next step in the dialog with setting options:

Multiple-choice questions do not have to be recoded and no/none can then be specified for the separator for Multiple. The part with Delete columns can also be left blank. The character encoding must match the encoding of your record (if you get an error message here, you can check that).

After downloading, it makes sense to check the code book for completeness or to make individual additions if necessary.

You can find more details [here.](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/360026144212)

**Upload the codebook back into Data Lion:**

The final codebook is uploaded as a .csv file in the project settings:
