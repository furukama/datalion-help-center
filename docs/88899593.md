# Helpcenter : How do I create charts with target groups/subgroups (filters)? \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 25, 2024

The diagrams or charts can be viewed for different target groups or subgroups.

The variables in the data set can also be used as filters. The filter menu is highlighted in blue:

There are three possibilities of filters in DataLion, which can also be combined: 1) Evaluation of subgroups; 2) Chart filters; 3) Global filters.

1.  **Subgroup evaluation**
    

1a) Subgroup evaluation with an existing variable in the dataset

Create a chart and select the filter variable. Drag & drop the filter variable or select it by mouse click (left).

1b) Subgroup evaluation with newly defined variable (filter / target group editor)

Call up the target group editor: The button "Create target group" takes you to the target group editor.

After calling up the editor, the navigation on the left jumps to "Filter/Target group" and individual characteristics can be dragged and dropped into the editor.

Select the characteristic relevant to you in the filter/target group navigation and drag and drop it into the editor. When dragging onto an empty field, additional proficiencies can be added, when dragging onto an already selected characteristic, brackets can be created.

The target group editor automatically sets AND as well as OR links. These can be adjusted with a click on the "AND" or "OR".

Adjust the target group formula by replacing the equal sign with greater than/smaller than (equal to). Or select a different proficiency than the one previously selected.

Now save the new target group by clicking on "Save" and assigning a name for the target group. The target group will be saved in the navigation under "My variables/filters" and can also be used for later evaluations (also for later sessions).:

2.  **Filter charts/diagrams to a target group (chart filter).**
    

You can also filter a chart/diagram to a specific target group and then display subgroups for this target group.

Simply drag the different groups and filters into the respective chart.

1.  Step: Define regions (north and south) as filters.

2.  Step: Define another variable as a filter, e.g. male

Step 3: Define the variable "male" as a chart filter.

Result:

3.  **Filter dashboard (all charts on one page) on one variable/characteristic (Global Filters)**

The filter variable must only be placed over the dashboard or simply double-clicked on. After that, the filter will be applied to the whole dashboard.
