# Helpcenter : How do I set a background image in the dashboard? \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 20, 2024

1.  **Upload background image**
    

In DataLion it is possible to set a background image for reports. To do this, the desired image must first be uploaded to the DataLion. You can do this in the project settings in the Media tab. After the image is uploaded, you can right-click to copy the link to this image (copy image address).

2.  **Insert background image**
    

After copying the link, go to the report settings. There, in the background image area, paste the previously copied link and save. The background image is now displayed in the report.
