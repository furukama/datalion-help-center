**Get started with DataLion**

**Registration**

Register an instance (this is the DataLion website through which you will later access all your projects):

[https://app.datalion.net/register](https://app.datalion.net/register)

![image-20240325-103652.png](/img/85524529.png?width=628)

You (and later your viewers) can access your DataLion projects via the DataLion URL.

*\[Note: This cannot be changed later, so please choose it carefully.\]*

Once registration is complete, you will have access to your personal DataLion instance.

DataLion is divided into Instance Management, the Backend, and the Frontend.

Feel free to use the Frontend and Backend tours to get a first impression of the user interface.

**Navigating to Instance Management**

-   Click on your name in the top right corner.
    
-   Select "Management" (or "Admin").
    

This will take you to your instance management, where you can create projects and users, perform updates, and configure basic settings for your account.

![image-20240325-104006.png](/img/85524548.png?width=316)

**Navigation Between Projects**

If you have multiple projects in your instance at a later time, click on "Projects" directly under your name to go to the homepage (frontend) of the desired project.

![image-20240325-104220.png](/img/85524554.png?width=316)

**Navigating to the Backend**

If you want to navigate back to the backend from the frontend at a later time, click on your name in the top right corner and then select "Project" (with the gear icon).

**Uploading data**

If you want to create your first DataLion dashboard using our demo dataset, you can download it here.

DataLion supports data uploads in all common formats (SAV, Excel, CSV).

*\[Note\] We recommend using an SAV dataset if possible, as this allows you to label variables and their values. DataLion will automatically use these labels.*

***Demo dataset***

The dataset includes 18 variables or questions and 500 entries.

![image-20240325-104338.png](/img/85524560.png?width=760)

The question variables (f1 – f6) are assigned the following labels and values:

If you want to use your own dataset, please check it in advance.

Please [verify](https://datalion.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/servicedesk/customer/confluence/shim/spaces/DC/pages/3441205) the following points in your dataset:

-   Recommended file format: UTF-8
    

-   Variable names do not contain dots, spaces, special characters, or leading digits
    
-   Variable names are a maximum of 64 characters long
    
-   There are no empty columns
    
-   Use a period as the decimal separator (can be converted during data upload if necessary)
    

To check your dataset for common pitfalls, feel free to use our DataLion Data Validator: [https://datalion.com/datacheck/](https://datalion.com/datacheck/)

***Data upload***

-   In the project backend, click on the "Data Sources" tab in the blue navigation bar.
    

*\[Note: Data is imported into data sources. For most projects, a single data source is sufficient; it will then contain all the data.\]*

-   Click on the automatically generated data source to access the data upload.
    

![image-20240325-104515.png](/img/85524566.png?width=760)

-   Click on "Choose file" and select your dataset. Then click "Save" at the bottom of the page.
    
-   You will now see a preview of your data. You can leave the settings at their default values (if your data uses commas as decimal separators, please select the "Convert comma to dot" option). Click "Save" again.
    
-   After a successful upload, you will see a preview of your data at the bottom of the page.
    

**Handling Missing Values**

*\[Note: The demo dataset contains missing values in variable f3 in the form of empty cells and the value 99\]*

-   In the project backend, click on the "Settings" tab in the blue navigation bar.
    
-   Click on "Missing Values". Define the values to be excluded from calculations as missing values. Enter multiple missing values separated by commas (e.g., 99, 997, 998).
    
-   Optionally, also set NULL and empty strings as missing values.
    
-   Define how missing values should be handled by default in the project (this setting can be overridden at the question level if necessary).
    
-   Click "Save" at the bottom of the page.
    

**Creating Your First Reports & Dashboards**

A project is divided into reports and dashboards. A report contains one or more dashboards (tabs) where your data can be visualized using different charts.

-   Switch to the frontend by clicking the eye icon on the right in the blue navigation bar.
    

![image-20240325-104605.png](/img/85524572.png?width=316)

-   Create a new report by clicking on the folder icon in the top right corner and then selecting "New Report". Name the report and click "OK". You can later navigate between your reports using the folder icon. You will now see your first dashboard, "New Tab".
    

![image-20240325-104640.png](/img/85524578.png?width=312)

-   By clicking on the arrow on the tab, you can rename, copy, label, save, or move your dashboard to another report.
    

![image-20240325-104724.png](/img/85524584.png?width=312)

-   Don’t forget to save your dashboard once you’ve made changes.
    
-   By clicking the “+” next to the tab, you can add another dashboard (tab) to the report.
    
-   On the left side, you will find the navigation bar (if it’s not visible, click on the burger menu; 3 bars in the top left). Here you can find all the variables included in your dataset by clicking on “Variables”.
    

*\[Note: You can permanently show or hide the navigation by clicking on your name in the top right corner and toggling it on/off under “Show/Hide Navigation”\]*

![image-20240325-104804.png](/img/85524590.png?width=380)

**Creating Basic Charts**

You can create a chart by clicking on a variable name or by dragging and dropping a question onto the dashboard.

![image-20240325-105414.png](/img/85524596.png?width=384)

By default, bar charts are created. You can then customize all charts individually.

The main chart settings can be found under the gear icon in the chart header:

-   [**Chart-Typ**](https://datalion.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/article/3473553)**s**: Here you can select how your data should be displayed. The most common chart types are:
    

-   For frequencies: Bar, Column, Pie, Donut, Line
    
-   For agreement scales: Stacked Bar, Stacked Column
    
-   For complex data: [Table](https://datalion.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/servicedesk/customer/confluence/shim/spaces/DC/pages/3539243)
    

**Metrics:** Here you can set how the data should be presented. By default, percentages are shown. The most common alternatives are “Absolute Values” and “Valid Percentages.”

**Sorting:** You can set this at the end of the list. By default, it sorts according to the order of your variables. You can also sort ascending/descending or alphabetically.

**New Chart Settings:** Here you can make individual settings (e.g., colors, background color, showing/hiding different aspects).

You can resize the chart by clicking the arrow in the bottom right corner of the chart.

**Double-click** on the chart title to manually change it.

-   [**Merging Questions**](https://datalion.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/article/8126487): Often, different questions with the same values need to be displayed in a single chart (usually with agreement scales). To do this:
    

-   Drag and drop the first chart onto the dashboard and set it to “stacked bar.”
    
-   Drag a second question with the same values onto the already created chart.
    
-   Click “OK” in the pop-up (setting “Merged”).
    

The chart will now display both categories:

![image-20240325-105655.png](/img/85524602.png?width=534)

In stacked charts, you can also create TOPx boxes under the settings (gear icon).

Information on handling multiple responses can be found [here](https://datalion.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/article/10879004).

**Filtering Data by Specific Attributes**

![image-20240325-105829.png](/img/85524608.png?width=276)

Switch to the "Filters/Target Groups" tab in the left navigation bar (the background changes from gray to blue). You can now use all variables as splits or filters.

Drag a variable onto an existing chart to split the data according to the variable's values (this is available in most chart types).

![image-20240325-105919.png](/img/85524614.png?width=276)

Click on a variable to see its individual values.

Drag a single value onto a chart to filter the data by that value. Adding more values will add them as splits.

   

![image-20240325-110057.png](/img/85524620.png?width=285)

Filter settings can be adjusted using the newly available filter icon in the chart settings (e.g., order, delete, etc.).

**Making Initial Design Customizations**

In DataLion, you have the option to completely and individually customize the design of your dashboards and projects.

**Customizing Charts**

In the default drag-and-drop mode, the dashboard is based on a grid where you can position your charts by moving the cursor over the chart header.

*\[Note: In drag-and-drop mode, the chart always takes a position at the top of the screen.\]*

You can change the size of the charts by either using the magnifying glass icon to switch between single, double, or triple options in both vertical and horizontal directions, or by moving the cursor to the bottom right corner of the chart and dragging it to the desired size.

**Text Boxes**

With text boxes, you can structure and organize your dashboard clearly. By clicking the “+” symbol in the top right corner, a new text box will be added to your dashboard.

![image-20240325-110353.png](/img/85524626.png?width=281)

To position the text box, simply click on it and, while holding down the left mouse button, move it to the desired location.

To resize the text box, drag it up or down from the bottom right corner while holding down the left mouse button.

The text box includes a WYSIWYG editor (“What You See Is What You Get” editor). In a WYSIWYG editor, a document is displayed on the screen during editing exactly as it will appear after being saved in the dashboard.

![image-20240325-110434.png](/img/85524632.png?width=760)

For more information on text boxes, please see [hier](https://datalion.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/article/10977314).

**Themes and Color Schemes**

In DataLion, you can choose from various themes (basic layout of your dashboards) and color schemes (colors of the charts).

You will find a selection in the backend under Settings at the bottom of the page. By checking the boxes, you allow the selection to be made directly in the frontend as well.

![image-20240325-110524.png](/img/85524638.png?width=764)

You also have the option to create your own themes and custom color schemes. Instructions can be found on the following pages:

[Create your own themes via CSS](https://datalion.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/article/17399829)

[Individual color schemes for questions/variables](https://datalion.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/article/20709424)

Additionally, you have the option to customize each chart and text box individually. This allows you to fully personalize the dashboard, with no limits to your creativity.

![image-20240325-110841.png](/img/85524644.png?width=772)

**Publishing Your Projects**

**Granting External Viewers Access to the Dashboard**

To publish your report, you can save it as public in the report settings and generate a link to the report. To do this, click on the gear icon in the relevant report in the upper left area.

![image-20240325-110956.png](/img/85524650.png?width=321)

**Exporting Charts and Dashboards**

In addition to using and presenting your data directly within the DataLion web application, DataLion also offers various export options. You can export entire reports, individual dashboards, or single charts as PDF, PowerPoint presentations, or Excel files. To do this, select the "Download" icon in the upper right corner of the frontend (or when hovering over a chart) and export the file in the desired format.

![image-20240325-111118.png](/img/85524656.png?width=324)

**Embedding a PowerPoint Master**

You also have the option to embed a PowerPoint master into your project, allowing you to export the PPTX file directly in your corporate design.

To integrate your prepared master into your project, navigate to the backend of your project. Information on configuring your master can be found [here](https://datalion.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/article/13565981).

*\[Note: When creating your master in PowerPoint, make sure to close the Slide Master view before saving.\]*
