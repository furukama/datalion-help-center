# Helpcenter : How can I change and customize fonts in DataLion? \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 20, 2024

You can change fonts for various elements in the project settings in the "Content" tab in the "Custom CSS Styles" section. For this you have to insert a CSS code at this point. You can find out how to use CSS [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/360021463799-What-is-CSS-).

The code structures for changing the font can be found [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/4426668104978-Specific-HTML-CSS-elements-in-DataLion).
