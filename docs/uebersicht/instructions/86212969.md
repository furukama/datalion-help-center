# Helpcenter : Where can I place CSS? \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 20, 2024

CSS style sheets can be inserted in the following areas:

-   In the admin area as a theme. Find out how this works [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/4409265627154-Eigene-Themes-mit-CSS-erstellen).
    
-   At a project level in Project Backend>Content>**Custom Style Section**.
    
-   At a report level in the report settings in the **Custom style sheet** area.

-   There is also the option of inserting CSS into **text boxes**. This only formats the dashboard on which the text box is located.
    

Sample code to paste into the source code of a text box:

```css
<style type="text/css">
.textfield {
background-color: blue !important;
}
</style>
```
