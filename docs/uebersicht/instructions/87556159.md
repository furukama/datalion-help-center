# Helpcenter : Generate automatic codebook \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 24, 2024

Labeled datasets can be visualized without manually creating a codebook with the Release 2021.2.

Advantages:

-   Faster results than ever before.
    

-   You do not have to generate a codebook manually and save the uploading process
    

-   Codebook is generated automatically and can thus still be edited later on
    

Example of a labeled dataset

**Under Backend >> Data >> Data Upload** you can upload your dataset as usual. You only have to check the box "Create Codebook after Import". This way the codebook will be created automatically and is directly uploaded in the backend:

You can work with the variables as usual, for example use them as filters and change chart types:

If you want to edit the codebook afterwards, you can export it, edit it and replace the existing codebook.
