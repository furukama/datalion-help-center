# Helpcenter : Define metric per chart via codebook \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 24, 2024

In the codebook there is the possibility to predefine the metric of a question. The definition is entered in the codebook column **Settings** in the line of the corresponding codebook question. The metric is entered encoded as a number.

Example:

```java
{"metric": 2}
```
