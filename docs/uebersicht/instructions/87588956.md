# Helpcenter : How do I make a conditional coloring of values in the tables? \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 24, 2024

You can create a conditional coloring for chart type "table" directly in the chart settings in the "layout" area:

The "operator" and "value" parameters can be used to define the values of the numbers to be formatted and which property (background or font) should be formatted in which color:

-   "operator":
    
-   `=`
    
-   `<`
    
-   `>`
    
-   `<=`
    
-   `>=`
    
-   "value": value of the cell
    
-   "color": hex code of the font color, e.g. "#55ff55"
    
-   "background": hex code of background color "#55ff55"
    
-   "columns": index(es) of columns to be formatted in \[ \]
    

The example to color all values greater than 100 in green and lower then 20 in red would be then the following:

```
[{"operator": ">=", "value": 100, "color": "#61a229"}, {"operator": "<", "value": 20, "color
```
