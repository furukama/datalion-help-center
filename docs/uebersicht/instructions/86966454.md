# Helpcenter : Management of rights (admin, editor, viewer) \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 23, 2024

# **Management of rights - Overview**

Rights management in DataLion is multi-level. The software offers user, project and finally report level. Rights can be adjusted and changed at any time.

**Please note**: Viewers (instance level) cannot be made project editor or project owner at the project level. Conversely, users who have editor/owner rights to a project cannot be made an instance-level viewer. Only admins (instance) can be project owners. 

1.  **User roles (user level)**
    

First, users are created in the DataLion administration:

Overview of the user roles:

2.  **Projects (project level)**
    

At a project level, the user rights are also defined in the user settings. Here, in the second tab "Projects":

**Important:** A project can be specified here, which is loaded after login. This way the user does not land on an empty page, but directly in the assigned project.

In the second part of the dialogue, the user roles or access profiles for individual projects are assigned.

Overview of the project (roles) for users:

Administrators can create individual access profiles for projects and activate them for different users. For example, the visibility of data in a project can be defined by the user:

3.  **Reports (report level)**
    

The reports can be created and released in the respective project.

In the report, there are again roles that you can assign to the respective users:

The default setting is that only owners (=creators) of a report can add users and editors. However, report owners *can* allow report editors to add report viewers and/or report editors to the report. For this, the desired setting is made in the **Project Settings>General>Reports and Dashboards**.

**IMPORTANT:** For someone to become an editor, they must first be created as a user in the report.
