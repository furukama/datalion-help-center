# Helpcenter : How to report problems and bugs \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 23, 2024

We are constantly working to make our dashboard software even more powerful, faster and easier to use. We are very grateful for information from our customers as to where there are still problems or where errors occur in daily operation.

In order to be able to diagnose errors as quickly as possible and to develop improvements, we have now released a new feature that makes it even easier for you to report bugs.

Please send us the following information:

-   The description of the problem, what exactly is not working.
    
    -   What are you doing to trigger the error?
        
    -   What behavior of the software does it trigger?
        
    -   What should happen instead?
        
-   Screenshots of where this problem occurs/screenshots of error messages.
    
-   Service link
    

Service Link:

Please use the "Copy Service Link" feature to give us access to your instance so that we can test what is not working for you.

For this you have to choose in the backend:

**System Settings → Service Account on / off**

and in the front end:

**User menu → Create Service Link.**
