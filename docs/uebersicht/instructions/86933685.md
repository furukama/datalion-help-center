# Helpcenter : Data import - column types and zero values \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 23, 2024

DataLion offers you different options for importing data. First, upload your data set as a csv file in the project-backend under Data as usual and save it. The following window appears:

You can choose how the columns are handled. This setting is especially important if you want to append many records.

-   Standard import
    
-   Optimize column lengths: Field lengths are automatically limited in the database (allows for wider data sets)
    
-   Optimize column types and lengths: The field types are also automatically recognized (but then empty fields in the data record must also be marked as NULL).
