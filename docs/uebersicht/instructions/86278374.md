# Helpcenter : Tips & tricks for working with HTML & CSS formatting in DataLion \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 20, 2024

1.  **Create backup copies of the code**
    

It makes sense to always save a backup copy of the homepage and CSS code as a Word or text document. If the code is thrown out for technical reasons or if an error creeps in, you always have the option of quickly returning to the original state.

2.  **Using a code checker**
    

If you want to test your code for functionality before inserting it into DataLion, you can use the following websites:

HTML: [https://validator.w3.org/#validate\_by\_input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

CSS: [http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

Code can be copied here and the tool returns whether the code is error-free or not.
