# Helpcenter : Clone a project \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher, last modified on Sept. 23, 2024

There are two variants of cloning projects:

-   Cloning **with** data: Data is copied.
    
-   Cloning **without** data: Data is only referenced, i.e. addressed by both projects. Attention: With this option, if you change/delete the data in the cloned project, or delete the whole cloned project, the data of the original project will also be deleted/changed.
    

  
Procedure:

1.  Go to the administration in the DataLion backend and click on projects.

2.  Find the project you want to clone in the project list and click on "Clone" in the corresponding row in the "Action" column.
    
3.  A selection menu appears: "Clone without data" and "Clone with data". Select the desired option with one click.
    

4.  The project is cloned, and you are taken to the project settings of the new, cloned project. There you can rename the cloned project.

In the project settings under the tab "Data" you can control which data source a project refers to. By default, the data sources are called dashboard_data_table_`<id>`. You can also subsequently change the data source to which the project is to refer here by entering the desired data source `<id>` in the field Data source.
