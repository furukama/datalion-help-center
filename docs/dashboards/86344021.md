# How do I create a start page/homepage for my project? [Article under maintenance]

A start page can be specified in DataLion, which is visible when a project is opened. This homepage can be specified in the project settings in the "Content" tab in the "Homepage" sub-item.

The homepage is created using HTML and the code is inserted in the sub-item Homepage. More information you can find [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/360021461619-What-is-HTML-).

A start page code can look like this - it contains a button that lies on a background image and links to the dashboard:

```
<div class="row" style="background-image: url('Link to the Picture'); background-repeat: no-repeat; min-height: 1000px; min-width: 700px; padding: 0 2em">
<a href="Link to Dashboard"`>`<h1 style="color:grey; font-size: 2.5em"; 
>To Dashboard</h1></a>
<div class="col-sm-12">
</div>
```
You can also limit yourself to a single link or just insert an image - as you wish.
