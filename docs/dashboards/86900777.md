# Access profiles [Article under maintenance]

### **What are access profiles?**

Access profiles in DataLion are a way to enable users to use a dashboard or report individually and possibly with restrictions. Thus, for example, the visibility of databases can be made as user-defined.

### **How to create an access profile?**

Access profiles are created and edited in the project settings ("Project"). The project settings are reached via the right navigation.

In the project settings under the "Access profiles" tab, individual access profiles can be created that are released for specific users.

A new access profile can be created using the “new” button. In the window that will open, the properties of the access profile can be defined in more detail.

### **What do the individual fields mean?**

**Description**

In the "Description" field, the access profile is given a meaningful name so that it can be clearly assigned later.

**Export project**

If "Export project" is ticked, users with this access profile can export the project. In the "Selective export" field, exporting can be restricted to individual tabs.

**Disable filter / read-only mode**

"Disable filters" hides all filters (e.g. drop-down filters) from the user. The reading mode also hides the question navigation on the left side of the dashboard. This setting can be further specified using the drop-down box.

**Configure your own target groups**

"Configure own target groups" allows the users of this access profile to configure their own target groups.

**Hide buttons**

In the "Hide buttons" field, elements from the user menu can be hidden, for example, "My reports" field.

**Include/exclude categories**

With the "Include/exclude categories" function, the display of certain question categories can be activated or deactivated in the left navigation area. Individual categories can be selected via the magnifying glass and finally included or excluded.

"**Filter**" ← this sets a global filter for all users with this access profile

**Exclude navigation for the following global filters**

This setting can be used to determine which global filters users with this access profile can see and use.

**Drop-down filter**

Filters for users can be preset here.

**Items displayed per page**

With the setting "Pagination show items per page" you can define how many elements that match the drop-down filter are displayed on each page.

**Default values for drop-down filter**

A filter standard can be specified via the “Default values for dropdown filter(s)” setting. You can find detailed information on the drop-down filters [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/360016234491-Wie-erstelle-ich-ein-Filter-Drop-Down-Men%C3%BC-inkl-Zeitreihen-Men%C3%BC-).

**Excel-report configuration**

Excel reports can also be configured for users via the access profiles. To do this, paste your code into the "Excel report configuration" field.

**An example:**

``
[`{"title": " My Report ", "ignore_empty_rows": true, "ignore_empty_columns": true, "hide_value_labels": true, "totals":[{"value":"n","label":"Total"}`], "filter": [], "columns": [`{"variable_id": 1}`,  `{"variable_id": 3, "label": "Länder ","filters": []}`],   "rows":  [  `{"variable_id": 3, "label": "Countries ","filters": []}`], "values": [`{"value": "columnPercent", "label": "%","format": "0%"}`]  }]
``

**Excel report caching**

Enabling the Excel report caching speeds up the Excel report for the user, since an Excel report is then kept on the server, which is automatically updated.

**Merge tags**

Placeholders for the report can be activated in the "Merge tags" field. Presets can be saved with the field "Preset report filter".

![mceclip11.png](/img/87195744.png)

**Share reports with users in this access profile**

You can also determine whether the reports should be shared with all users in the relevant access profile.

**API-settings**  

In the API settings you define the parameters that are necessary for a data connection via our API interface.

Once you have made the desired settings, you can save and use the access profile.
