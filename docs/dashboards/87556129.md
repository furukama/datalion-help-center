# Codebook: Different bases + calculate the base of a question yourself [Article under maintenance]

**Different basis**

If you would like to use the basis of another question/value for a question/value, you can do this by setting as a basis the Row\_id of the desired basic question/variable with the code _`{"basis":Row\_id}`_ in the Settings column of the codebook.

Example: `{"basis":21}`

**Calculated Basis**

You can also calculate your own basis yourself. To do this, create a codebook question with an SQL query that is used to calculate the basis.

Example of a calculated basis:

`{{= COUNT(dashboard_data_table_12.var_filter='2')}}`
