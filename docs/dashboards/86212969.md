# Where can I place CSS? [Article under maintenance]

CSS style sheets can be inserted in the following areas:

-   In the admin area as a theme. Find out how this works [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/articles/4409265627154-Eigene-Themes-mit-CSS-erstellen).
    
-   At a project level in Project Backend>Content>**Custom Style Section**.
    
-   At a report level in the report settings in the **Custom style sheet** area.
