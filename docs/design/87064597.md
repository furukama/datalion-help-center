# Data preparation / preprocessing for the upload [Article under maintenance]

For datasets to be uploaded to DataLion without any problems and to be interpreted by the tool, the following points must be considered.

1.  **Correct designation of the columns / column names.**
    

There must be

-   no dots
    
-   no spaces
    
-   no special characters
    
-   no empty columns
    

be contained in the column caption. While uploading files that contain dots/spaces/... in the column headers, an error message will appear. Furthermore, the variable names should not use more than 64 characters.

2.  **Point instead of comma as decimal separators**
    

DataLion can only process dots as decimal separators. In the CSV, commas in numbers must therefore be replaced by dots. Replacing in Excel is not sufficient in this case, so this must be done either in Notepad++ (Windows) or Sublime or Text-Editor (Mac OS) via Find - Replace (if it is a pure number dataset, otherwise be careful with commas in texts).

3.  **file format**
    

The data must be uploaded as .csv in UTF-8 encoding so that the system can interpret it correctly.
