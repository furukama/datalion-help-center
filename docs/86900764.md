# Helpcenter : Mouseover settings \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 23, 2024

The settings for the mouseover can be found here: General > Display Options.

It can be defined whether a mouseover should be shown and which metric it should show.

"Case numbers" shows the absolute values.

By the way: The mouseover can also be controlled with CSS and JavaScript. More information about CSS in DataLion can be found [here](https://datalion.zendesk.com/hc/de/sections/4425833827474-Formatting-in-DataLion).
