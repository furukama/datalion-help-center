# Helpcenter : SQL-queries in the codebook: Subqueries with placeholders \[Article under maintenance\]

Created by Mario Bacher on Sept. 24, 2024

In SQL queries in the codebook, standard dropdown filters applied to dashboards can also be inserted into subqueries by means of a placeholder. The `%%gfv%%` placeholder is used to insert the active filters into the subquery. The variables must exist in the table of the subquery.

Example formula with subquery:

`{{=SUM(var_numeric) + (SELECT SUM(var_numeric) FROM dashboard_data_table_12 ABC %%gfv%%)}}`
